						Hey! My name is Olivia and I love making heads turn for some strangely unique reasons. And just when you thought foot painting was jaw-dropping, wait till you see my works. It’s truly modern art personified. And simply put, no one’s complaining at how I break stereotypes. God gifted glories and a bit of talent is what I use to produce masterpieces. And you’ve literally got to see it to believe it.

						<h5>A stamp that interests everyone</h5>
						<p>
							Over the last year, Ukrainians have been at a loss as to whether Russia would attack their territory. On February 24, Ukrainians woke up to the news that a full-scale war had begun. It was then that it became clear that the past was something that was inaccessible, and the time had come when citizens had to unite. And so began the story of one stamp that quickly went around the world and became coveted by many thinking people.
						</p>

						<h5>Snake Island: how events developed</h5>
						<p>
							The first day of the war was drawing to a close, and it was useless to hope for good news. However, a ray of light appeared: the opportunity to follow the events on the Snake Island was an impetus to the resistance. Border guards, who later became famous, had to defend the strategic point.
							<br>
							The reason for the popularity was the recording of a conversation with the occupiers. The attackers decided to negotiate " in a good way" and proposed to surrender the island for a reward. However, their promises did not appeal to the military. The marine was able to find the words and send the "Russian ship" on a long voyage.
						</p>

						<h5>Destruction of the ship "Moscow"</h5>
						<p>
							The cruiser " Moscow" has always been a source of pride for the Russian authorities, so it was not part of her plans to lose the ship during the war. However, the Ukrainian military decided to make some changes and finished the task begun by the border guards on February 24. The attack of the ship was very important for the Ukrainians, so there was no chance for error.
							<br>
							On April 14 thanks to coordinated work it was possible to achieve the objectives and the cruiser "Moscow" performed a "negative" surfacing. High-precision Neptune missiles were used for this purpose. The hit cruiser first tried to bail out to the shores of the Crimean Peninsula, but this plan also failed.
						</p>

						<h5>Stages of the brand creation</h5>
						<p>
							This event did not go unnoticed. That's why UkrPoshta announced its intention to produce a stamp with a story of historical significance. Such a proposal caused admiration, so it was necessary to start a contest.
						</p>

						<h5>Contest and popularity of the stamp</h5>
						<p>
							Ukrposhta announced the start of the contest on its social network page. In a short time, more than 500 requests from professionals and beginners, individuals and legal entities, adults and children were considered. Voting for the designs was held in the app "Diia" and on the pages of the postal company.
							<br>
							About 650 thousand Ukrainians voted for the design, which adorns the stamp today. The winner was Boris Groh, a professional artist born and grew up in Yevpatoria. In 2014, he was forced to leave home and start a new life from scratch.
							<br>
							The unique stamp quickly became popular. Every Ukrainian would like to receive such a gift, because the drawing with the inscription has acquired the status of symbolic. The message to the occupants on the stamp is a symbol of faith in strength and victory, fidelity and hope.
						</p>

						<h5>The reaction of Russians to the appearance of the historical stamp</h5>
						<p>
							While Ukrainians are fighting for their lives and homes, Russians cannot accept the fact that they have no right to talk about the war. The long years of propaganda have not been in vain, and the release of the famous stamp has revealed the results. The launch of the online sale was disrupted by Russian hackers attacking the sites offering to buy the products.
							<br>
							After the purchase of stamps became available to Ukrainians again, the Russians decided to make a clever move. Similar offers appeared in Russian post offices, but with a different meaning. On the Russian stamps there are calls to oppose Azov and actively fight against Nazism in Ukraine. However, this news did not cause a stir.
						</p>
						
						<h5>Why is the stamp so valuable</h5>
						<p>
							Ukrainians have shown their best side and are trying to support each other. This is the kind of unity many generations have dreamed of, but only now it has become possible. The interest in the unique stamp is increasing, because in this way you can:
							<ul>
								<li>support Ukraine in difficult times;</li>
								<li>get a symbol of confrontation with the invaders;</li>
								<li>remember an important event.</li>
							</ul>

							The head of the postal service said that the size of the edition will be limited. Despite the fact that the number of copies exceeds the usual number of products, not everyone who wishes can receive a stamp. The unique event and originality is the primary reason for its popularity.
							<br>
							You can get the desired stamp in your collection with delivery to any corner of the globe. The original packaging and exclusive products perfectly complement each other.
